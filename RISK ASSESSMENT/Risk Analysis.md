# Risk Analysis

This document covers the **analysis phase** of the enterprise risk management process.  
In this phase, each identified risk is assessed for **likelihood** and **impact**.  
The results are summarized in a **risk matrix** to determine overall risk levels.

---

## Likelihood Assessment
- Assign a likelihood score (1–5) for each risk based on probability of occurrence.
- Example:
  - 1 = Rare
  - 2 = Unlikely
  - 3 = Possible
  - 4 = Likely
  - 5 = Almost Certain

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood (1-5) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1       |                 |                 |
| 2       |                 |                 |
| 3       |                 |                 |
| 4       |                 |                 |
| 5       |                 |                 |

## Impact Assessment
- Assign an impact score (1–5) for each risk based on severity.
- Example:
  - 1 = Insignificant
  - 2 = Minor
  - 3 = Moderate
  - 4 = Major
  - 5 = Catastrophic

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact (1-5) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1       |                 |               |
| 2       |                 |               |
| 3       |                 |               |
| 4       |                 |               |
| 5       |                 |               |

## Risk Matrix
- This **5x5 matrix** visually combines likelihood and impact to determine risk level.

| Impact \ Likelihood | 1 Rare | 2 Unlikely | 3 Possible | 4 Likely | 5 Almost Certain |
|--------------------|--------|------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **5 Catastrophic** |        |            |            |          |                |
| **4 Major**        |        |            |            |          |                |
| **3 Moderate**     |        |            |            |          |                |
| **2 Minor**        |        |            |            |          |                |
| **1 Insignificant**|        |            |            |          |                |

> You can fill each cell with the **risk level** (Low, Medium, High, Extreme) for reference.

## Risk Scoring Table
- Multiply **Likelihood × Impact** to calculate **Risk Score**.  
- Use this score to categorize risks and prioritize treatment.

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score (L×I) | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1       |            |           |        |                 |            |
| 2       |            |           |        |                 |            |
| 3       |            |           |        |                 |            |
| 4       |            |           |        |                 |            |
| 5       |            |           |        |                 |            |

## Notes:
- All scoring and evaluation in this phase feeds into **Risk Evaluation** and **Treatment Planning**.
- You can add additional columns such as **existing controls** or **risk owner** in your next phase if needed.
