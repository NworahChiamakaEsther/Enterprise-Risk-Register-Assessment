# Risk Monitoring and Review

## Monitoring Approach
- Periodic review of the risk register
- Tracking of treatment plan implementation
- Reassessment of risks after major changes

## Review Frequency
- High risks: Quarterly
- Medium risks: Bi-annually
- Low risks: Annually

The risk register will be updated to reflect changes in risk exposure and control effectiveness.
