# Risk Monitoring and Review

### Risk Status Report (Summary View)

| Risk ID        | Risk Level | Trend | KRI Status | Control Effectiveness | Action Required |
|---------------|------------|-------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| RISK-TPR-001  | Critical   | Stable | Within threshold | Partially Effective | Vendor reassessment |
| RISK-CYB-002  | High       | Increasing | Threshold exceeded | Partially Effective | Accelerate patching |

---


## Monitoring Approach
- Periodic review of the risk register
- Tracking of treatment plan implementation
- Reassessment of risks after major changes

##  Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

### Third-Party Vendor Risk (RISK-TPR-001)

| KRI | Description | Threshold | Monitoring Frequency |
|----|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Vendor security certification status | SOC 2 / ISO 27001 validity | Certification lapse | Quarterly |
| Number of high-risk vendors | Vendors rated high or critical | > 2 vendors | Quarterly |
| Vendor access violations | Unauthorized or excessive access | > 0 incidents | Monthly |
| Vendor audit findings | High or critical findings | Any unresolved finding | Annually |

---
### Ransomware Risk (RISK-CYB-002)

| KRI | Description | Threshold | Monitoring Frequency |
|----|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Malware detection events | Number of ransomware indicators | > baseline | Monthly |
| Backup success rate | Successful backup completion | < 95% | Weekly |
| Patch compliance rate | Systems fully patched | < 90% | Monthly |
| Phishing failure rate | Users failing simulations | > 10% | Quarterly |

---
##  Risk Review Frequency

| Risk Category | Review Type | Frequency |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Third-Party Risk | Vendor risk reassessment | Annually |
| Third-Party Risk | Access review | Quarterly |
| Cybersecurity Risk | Threat landscape review | Quarterly |
| Cybersecurity Risk | Incident response testing | Annually |


## Alignment With Risk Management Frameworks

### ISO 31000 Alignment
- Monitoring and Review: Sections 5–8
- Communication and Consultation: Sections 9–10
- Continuous Improvement: Section 11

### COSO ERM Alignment
- Monitoring Activities: Ongoing KRI tracking
- Information, Communication, and Reporting: Risk reports
- Risk Response Evaluation: Residual risk review

The risk register will be updated to reflect changes in risk exposure and control effectiveness.
