# Risk Register Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains all risk registers related to the organization's enterprise, cybersecurity, and third-party vendor risks.  
The registers document identified risks, assess likelihood and impact, define controls, and track residual risk after treatment.

## Folder Contents

1. **[Comprehensive Risk Register](comprehensive-risk-register.md)**  
   - Full lifecycle of risks including initial assessment, existing controls, treatment, and residual risk.

2. **[Risk Scoring Matrix](risk-scoring-matrix.md)**  
   - Likelihood × Impact table used to calculate risk levels.

3. **[Residual Risk Register](residual-risk-register.md)**  
   - Updated register showing risks after treatment measures are applied.

## Methodology

- Risks are identified through a combination of process reviews, third-party assessments, and cybersecurity threat analysis.
- Likelihood and impact are rated on a **1–5 scale**, where:
  - **1 = Rare / Negligible**
  - **5 = Almost Certain / Severe**
- Risk score = Likelihood × Impact.
- Risk levels are classified as:
  - **Low:** 1–5
  - **Medium:** 6–10
  - **High:** 11–15
  - **Critical:** 16–25
- Residual risk is calculated post-treatment to show ongoing exposure.

---

## Alignment With Frameworks
- **ISO 31000:** Risk assessment, evaluation, and treatment lifecycle.
- **COSO ERM:** Enterprise-wide risk identification, assessment, and monitoring.
- **NDPR, GDPR,:** Data protection compliance for third-party and cybersecurity risks.

---

## How to Use
- Review the risk registers to understand initial, mitigated, and residual risk levels.
- Reference the Risk Scoring Matrix for calculation methodology.
- Update residual risk as treatment actions are implemented.
- Ensure all risk owners monitor assigned risks and report changes regularly.
